# Weather Trend Forecasting Project

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project analyzes global weather trends using machine learning and time-series forecasting techniques. The goal is to uncover climate patterns, detect anomalies, and improve forecast accuracy using multiple models.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing values, outliers, and normalization.
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visualize trends and correlations.
- Build and compare **multiple forecasting models** (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Linear Regression, Ensemble).
- Implement **anomaly detection** for weather pattern irregularities.
- Conduct **climate analysis**, spatial analysis, and environmental impact studies.
- Present findings in a **report, dashboard, and GitHub repository**.
